    "summary": "The processes involved in shaping latitudinal‐diversity gradients (LDGs) have been a longstanding source of debate and research. Climatic, historical and evolutionary factors have all been shown to contribute to the formation of LDGs. However, meta‐analyses have shown that different clades have LDG slopes that may vary in more than one order of magnitude. Such large variation cannot be explained solely by climatic or historical factors (e.g. difference in surface area between temperate and tropical zones) given that all clades within a geographic region are subject to the same conditions. Therefore, biotic processes intrinsic to each taxonomic group could be relevant in explaining rate differences in diversity decline across latitudinal gradients among groups. In this study, we developed a model simulating multiple competing species subjected (or not) to a demographic Allee effect. We simulated the range expansion of these species across an environmental gradient to show how these two overlooked factors (competition and Allee effects) are capable of modulating LDGs. Allee effects resulted in a steeper LDG given a higher probability of local extinction and lower colonization capacity compared to species without Allee effects. Likewise, stronger competition also led to a steeper decline in species diversity compared to scenarios with weaker species antagonistic interactions. This pattern occurred mostly due to the strength of priority effects, wherein scenarios with strong competition, species that dispersed earlier in the landscape were able to secure many patches whereas late‐arriving species were progressively precluded from expanding their ranges. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of biotic processes in shaping macroecological patterns could be more important than it is currently appreciated.",

    "summary": "The hierarchical branching nature of river networks can have a strong influence on the assembly of freshwater communities. This unique structure has spurred the development of the network position hypothesis (NPH), which states that the strength of different assembly processes depends on the community position in the river network. Specifically, it predicts that 1) headwater communities should be exclusively controlled by the local environment given that they are more isolated and environmentally heterogeneous relative to downstream reaches. In contrast, 2) downstream communities should be regulated by both environmental and dispersal processes due to increased connectivity given their central position in the riverscape. Although intuitive, the NPH has only been evaluated on a few catchments and it is not yet clear whether its predictions are generalizable. To fill this gap, we tested the NPH on river dwelling fishes using an extensive dataset from 28 French catchments. Stream and climatic variables were assembled to characterize environmental conditions and graph theory was applied on river networks to create spatial variables. We tested both predictions using variation partitioning analyses separately for headwater and downstream sites in each catchment. Only 10 catchments supported both predictions, 11 failed to support at least one of them, while in 7 the NPH was partially supported given that spatial variables were also significant for headwater communities. We then assembled a dataset at the catchment scale (e.g. topography, environmental heterogeneity, network connectivity) and applied a classification tree analysis (CTA) to determine which regional property could explain these results. The CTA showed that the NPH was not supported in catchments with high heterogeneity in connectivity among sites. In more homogeneously connected catchments, the NPH was only supported when headwaters were more environmentally heterogeneous than downstream sites. We conclude that the NPH is context dependent even for taxa dispersing exclusively within streams.",

    "summary": "AIMWe investigated how freshwater microcrustaceans with different susceptibilities to Allee effects differ in the distribution of their geographical range size (GRS) and diversity along latitudinal gradients, evaluating the importance of climatic and historical factors in explaining these differences. We hypothesized that sexual copepods would have a smaller GRS and that their distribution would be linked to historical processes due to mate‐finding Allee effects during colonization. Given that cyclic parthenogenetic cladocerans avoid these Allee effects, we predicted that they would exhibit a larger GRS and their distribution would be related to climatic factors rather than dispersal limitation. LOCATIONCanadian watersheds, North America. METHODSWe used a database containing the presence–absence of freshwater zooplankton across 1665 Canadian lakes along a latitudinal gradient of 40°. We computed GRS using minimum convex polygons encompassing all lakes in which each species was present. We pooled the diversity of lakes within watersheds, and computed linear regressions models between watershed diversity and average GRS with the average latitude, distance from a glacial refugium and environmental variables of the watershed. All analyses were performed separately for cladocerans and copepods. RESULTSCladocerans exhibited, on average, a GRS 70% larger than that of copepods. We found a strong relationship between diversity (negative) and average GRS (positive) with latitude for cladocerans but not for copepods. Cladoceran macroecological patterns were mainly explained by climatic factors, whereas the lack of latitudinal gradients in copepods was potentially due to the influence of a northern glacial refuge and dispersal limitation. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our results show that Allee effects are strongly and negatively associated with GRS, influencing the relative importance of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation on species diversity patterns. We suggest that studies should avoid lumping species with large differences in their susceptibility to Allee effects in order to better disentangle the multiple processes affecting large‐scale patterns.",

    "summary": "Dispersal has long been recognized as a mechanism that shapes many observed ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, understanding the factors that promote its evolution remains a major goal in evolutionary ecology. Landscape connectivity may mediate the trade-off between the forces in favour of dispersal propensity (e.g. kin-competition, local extinction probability) and those against it (e.g. energetic or survival costs of dispersal). It remains, however, an open question how differing degrees of landscape connectivity may select for different dispersal strategies. We implemented an individual-based model to study the evolution of dispersal on landscapes that differed in the variance of connectivity across patches ranging from networks with all patches equally connected to highly heterogeneous networks. The parthenogenetic individuals dispersed based on a flexible logistic function of local abundance. Our results suggest, all else being equal, that landscapes differing in their connectivity patterns will select for different dispersal strategies and that these strategies confer a long-term fitness advantage to individuals at the regional scale. The strength of the selection will, however, vary across network types, being stronger on heterogeneous landscapes compared with the ones where all patches have equal connectivity. Our findings highlight how landscape connectivity can determine the evolution of dispersal strategies, which in turn affects how we think about important ecological dynamics such as metapopulation persistence and range expansion.",

    "summary": "The metacommunity framework has greatly advanced our understanding about the importance of local and regional processes structuring ecological communities. However, information on how metacommunity structure and the relative strengths of their underlying mechanisms change through time is largely lacking. Dynamic systems that undergo environmental temporal changes and disturbances, such as floodplains, serve as natural laboratories to explore how their metacommunity structure change in time. Here we applied the Elements of Metacommunity Structure framework and variation partitioning analysis to assess how temporal changes in the local environmental factors and regional dispersal processes in the rain season influence a seasonal floodplain‐fish metacommunity. Across four months, relevant environmental factors were measured across 21 patches where over 3500 individual fish were sampled. Connectivity was measured using landscape resistance‐based metrics and additional spatial variation in metacommunity structure was assessed via spatial autocorrelation functions. The metacommunity structure changed from nestedness, at the beginning of the flood season, to a quasi‐Clementsian gradient at the end. Our analyses show that connectivity is only important in the beginning of the flood season whereas environment is only important at the end. These results suggest that this metacommunity is structured by changes between dispersal limitation and environmental filtering through time.",

    "summary": "Ecological communities show extremely complex patterns of variation in space, and quantifying the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors underpinning patterns of species distributions is one of the main goals of community ecology. Although we have accumulated good knowledge about the processes driving species distributions within metacommunities, we have few insights about whether (and how) environmental and spatial features can actually generate consistent species distributional patterns across multiple metacommunities. In this paper we applied the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to identify and classify metacommunities according to multiple but discrete patterns of species distributions. Given that each pattern has unique underlying structuring mechanisms, exploring and comparing such patterns across multiple metacommunities spanning large geographical areas provides a way to test the existence of general principles underlying species distributions within metacommunities. In this study, we applied the EMS framework into a data set containing about 9000 lakes distributed across 85 fish metacommunities across Ontario, Canada, and estimated the relative importance of local and spatial factors in explaining their distributional patterns. Nested and Clementsian gradients were the patterns that fitted most metacommunities; nested metacommunities were distributed throughout the province, while Clementsian gradient metacommunities were concentrated in the southeastern region. Sixty‐five percent of nested metacommunities were located in low‐energy watersheds (i.e., colder climate and shorter growing season), whereas metacommunities representing Clementsian gradients were present in high‐energy watersheds (i.e., relatively warmer climate and longer growing season). Taken together, our results reveal that the environmental and spatial properties in which metacommunities are embedded are at least partially responsible for their species distributional patterns.",

    "summary": "Aim: This study aimed at describing and discussing the leachates mineralization (aerobic and anaerobic) of two species of aquatic macrophytes (Salvinia molesta and Myriophyllum aquaticum) from a tropical reservoir (22° 00’ S and 47° 54’ W); Methods: The incubations were prepared with plant leachates and reservoir water sample and were maintained during 45 days in the dark (at 20 °C). The organic carbon and the oxygen consumption kinetics were evaluated; Results: Irrespective of to the experimental condition, the leachates were mainly utilized for catabolic processes (i.e., respiration), mineralization was slightly faster in an aerobic environment (1.22 fold) and in this condition, the yield of refractory products was smaller (2.3%); the O/C stoichiometric ratios values (oxygen consumed per atom of carbon) from mineralization of the 2 types of leachates were similar (ca. 1.12);Conclusions: According to these results we conclude that the leachate from selected macrophytes is rapidly decomposed and subsidize primariy the microbial catabolism (aerobic or anaerobic); in addition, we propose that S. molesta contributes more to the input of dissolved organic matter within the reservoir.",

    "summary": "The present study discussed the kinetic aspects of leachate decomposition from an aquatic macrophyte, Pistia stratiotes L (water lettuce). This species was collected from Barra Bonita Reservoir located in the State of São Paulo (Brazil). Decomposition chambers were prepared with high molecular weight (HMW), low molecular weight (LMW) and integral (INT = HMW + LMW) dissolved organic matter (DOM) diluted with reservoir water. The samples were incubated at 20 °C, in darkness and under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. For 79 days, the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and organic carbon (OC) were measured. For calculating the deoxygenation coefficients (kd) and maximum oxygen consumption (COmax) the concentration of DO was integrated and fitted to a first-order kinetics model, which also applied to the depletion of OC concentrations. The COmax of INT incubations were 4% higher than the sum of HMW and LMW fractions. The deoxygenation coefficients, kd, had the same order of magnitude for all treatments. In relation to carbon decay, regardless of the availability of oxygen, the INT DOM also showed higher mineralisation. These results suggest that the leachate mineralisations are short-term processes; when the fractionation of the leachates occurs, the LMW had organic compounds with more accessibility for heterotrophic metabolism. On the other hand, when compared to INT DOM, the HMW and LMW were less consumed suggesting an interaction of the reactivity of the leachate. Our data suggest that in the Barra Bonita Reservoir the mineralisation of P. stratiotes leachates occurs through two competitive pathways (i.e. mineralisation of the labile compounds and formation of recalcitrant organic resources and their mineralisation) in which the oxygen availability and the molecular mass of DOM can interfere in the rates of reactions.",

I thus assume that you already know what a null model is. :) Otherwise, there is an excellent book on the subject (Gotelli and Graves, 1996) that is freely available to download here.\nWhy use parallel processing? The simple answer is time. If something takes less time done through parallel processing, why not do it? Computers nowadays have multi core processors with sufficient amount of memory available to run parallel processing. Instead of waiting a long time for a task to complete, one can divide the taks to run in multiple cores and thus obtain outputs much faster.\nBefore deciding to parallelize your code, remember that there is a trade-off between performance and simplicity. It takes some time to set up the parallel cluster so if your code already runs fast it is not worth it. If your code repeats a similar task over and over (e.g., bootstraping) then it is recommended to parallize to improve performance. Hence, parallel computing is ideal for null models.\nWhile there are many good tutorials on parallel computing in R out there, I think it is better to provide a small introduction on how to set up a parallel cluster and how to start coding in parallel before jumping on the null models.\nR packages\rThere are many packages to run parallel processing in R. Here are a few examples:\n\rparallel\rsnow\rdoSNOW\rdoParallel\rforeach\r\rFirst install packages install.packages(\u0026quot;doParallel\u0026quot;). The doParallel library installs both parallel and foreach packages.\nThen set up a parallel cluster. Use the function detectCores from the parallel library to detect the number of cores in your computer. It is always recommended to leave one core free for the computer to run other processes. For simplicity we will use 2 cores in this example.\nlibrary(doParallel)\r## Loading required package: foreach\r## Loading required package: iterators\r## Loading required package: parallel\rdetectCores()\r## [1] 4\rcl \u0026lt;- makeCluster(2, type = \u0026#39;PSOCK\u0026#39;)\rThis will create a Parallel Socket Cluster (PSOCK). This type of cluster only starts with the base packages and thus you need to export additional variables, functions and packages to the cluster (see further below) if you need them in your parallel code.\nYou can also create a FORK cluster, which has better capabilities to manage memory and already contain all the variables from the local environment (i.e., no need for export) since all the cores share the same memory. For this, use: cl \u0026lt;- makeCluster(2, type = 'FORK') Note, however, that Windows does not support FORK clusters.\n\rforeach loops\rAn intuitive way to perform a parallel process is to use the foreach function which looks like a for loop but operates as a lapply() function. As a first example we will perform the foreach function in sequential mode by using %do%\nlibrary(foreach)\rforeach(i = 1:6) %do% {\rsqrt(i)\r}\r## [[1]]\r## [1] 1\r## ## [[2]]\r## [1] 1.414214\r## ## [[3]]\r## [1] 1.732051\r## ## [[4]]\r## [1] 2\r## ## [[5]]\r## [1] 2.236068\r## ## [[6]]\r## [1] 2.44949\rIn the example above we applied sqrt() on each “i”. By default, foreach returns the output in a list format. You can combine the results in different ways. For instance if you want a vector output you can add the argument “.combine = c”.\nforeach(i = 1:6, .combine = c) %do% {\rsqrt(i)\r}\r## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490\rIf you want to use the foreach in parallel mode, you need to change %do% to %dopar%. You also need to register the cluster. Here we use the doParallel package to do this.\nregisterDoParallel(cl)\rforeach(i = 1:6, .combine = c) %dopar% {\rsqrt(i)\r}\r## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490\rIf you want to use a variable or object from the global environment in the parallel cluster, you first need to export it either using the clusterExport function, or using the .export argument in the foreach function. Here I use the .export argument for exporting.\nvar1 \u0026lt;-10\rvar2 \u0026lt;-5\rforeach(i = 1:6, .combine = c, .export = c(\u0026quot;var1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;var2\u0026quot;)) %dopar% {\r(var1+var2)*i\r}\r## Warning in e$fun(obj, substitute(ex), parent.frame(), e$data): already\r## exporting variable(s): var1, var2\r## [1] 15 30 45 60 75 90\rIf you need to use a particular function in the parallel cluster, you also need to export it. Here I use the clusterExport function.\nis_even \u0026lt;- function(x) x %% 2 == 0\rclusterExport(cl, c(\u0026quot;var1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;var2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;is_even\u0026quot;))\rforeach(i = 1:6, .combine = c) %dopar% {\ris_even((var1+var2)*i)\r}\r## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE\rIf you need to use a function from a R package in the parallel cluster, you need to export the package in the cluster as well. This can be done by the argument “.package” in the foreach function or by using the ClusterEvalQ function.\nLet’s use the ChickWeigth dataset which contains the variables weigth, Time, Chick and Diet. We want to compute the growth of each chick (i.e., weigth ~ Time). We can use the dplyr package to subset each chick from the dataset and then apply the lm function to each one separately. Here we want the coefficients of the linear model as a result and we will combine them by rows by using “.combine = rbind”.\ndata(\u0026quot;ChickWeight\u0026quot;)\rclusterEvalQ(cl,library(\u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;))\r## [[1]]\r## [1] \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot; \u0026quot;stats\u0026quot; \u0026quot;graphics\u0026quot; \u0026quot;grDevices\u0026quot; \u0026quot;utils\u0026quot; \u0026quot;datasets\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;methods\u0026quot; \u0026quot;base\u0026quot; ## ## [[2]]\r## [1] \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot; \u0026quot;stats\u0026quot; \u0026quot;graphics\u0026quot; \u0026quot;grDevices\u0026quot; \u0026quot;utils\u0026quot; \u0026quot;datasets\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;methods\u0026quot; \u0026quot;base\u0026quot;\rclusterExport(cl,\u0026quot;ChickWeight\u0026quot;)\rlength(unique(ChickWeight$Chick))\r## [1] 50\r#there are 50 unique chicks in this data\rGrowth_coeff\u0026lt;- foreach(i = 1:50, .combine = rbind, .packages = \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;) %dopar% {\rtemp_data \u0026lt;- ChickWeight %\u0026gt;% filter(Chick == i)\rGrowth = lm(weight ~ Time, data = temp_data)\rcoefficients(Growth)\r}\rhead(Growth_coeff)\r## (Intercept) Time\r## result.1 24.46544 7.987899\r## result.2 24.72485 8.719861\r## result.3 23.17955 8.487370\r## result.4 32.86568 6.088640\r## result.5 16.89563 10.055362\r## result.6 44.12343 6.378006\rIn the example above the combine = .rbind argument combined coefficients(Growth) into the Growth_coeff output.\nFinally, let’s see how much time do we save by using the parallelized code. In this case we will repeat the above code 100 times and use the system.time function to determine how much times it takes to run.\nFirst in sequential mode (%do%)\ntrials \u0026lt;- 100\rsystem.time({\rGrowth_coeff \u0026lt;- foreach(icount(trials), .combine=rbind, .packages = \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;) %do% {\rtemp_coeff\u0026lt;-matrix(numeric(),ncol=2,nrow=50)\rfor(i in 1:50){\rtemp_data \u0026lt;- ChickWeight %\u0026gt;% filter(Chick == i)\rGrowth = lm(weight ~ Time, data = temp_data)\rtemp_coeff[i,]=coefficients(Growth)\r}\rtemp_coeff\r}\r})\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39;\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;:\r## ## filter, lag\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;:\r## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\r## user system elapsed ## 11.23 0.13 11.68\rAnd now in parallel mode (%dopar%)\ntrials \u0026lt;- 100\rsystem.time({\rGrowth_coeff \u0026lt;- foreach(icount(trials), .combine=rbind, .packages = \u0026quot;dplyr\u0026quot;) %dopar% {\rtemp_coeff\u0026lt;-matrix(numeric(),ncol=2,nrow=50)\rfor(i in 1:50){\rtemp_data \u0026lt;- ChickWeight %\u0026gt;% filter(Chick == i)\rGrowth = lm(weight ~ Time, data = temp_data)\rtemp_coeff[i,]=coefficients(Growth)\r}\rtemp_coeff\r}\r})\r## user system elapsed ## 0.08 0.02 10.48\rAs you can see, the script takes more than 10 seconds in sequential mode but less than 7 seconds in parallel mode.\n\r",
