# About me

Hello! I'm Renato.
I am postdoctoral researcher at Irstea Aix-En-Provence. I'm interested in understanding how species are distributed across space and what are the drivers behind these geographical distributions. I am also interested in biodiversity patterns from local to continental scales and under both taxonomic and functional perspectives. My work focuses on freshwater systems such as lakes, streams and floodplains. However, I seldom get wet! I prefer to work behind a computer with large datasets and apply multivariate statistics, spatial analysis and other quantitative methods to understand how these ecosystems are structured.
