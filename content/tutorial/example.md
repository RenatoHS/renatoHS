If something takes less time if done through parallel processing, why not do it and save time? Computers nowadays have multi core processors with sufficient amount of memory available allowing for parallel computing. Instead of waiting for a long time while a task completes, one can replace the code sequential code with a parallel one, and divide a given task execution time by a factor of 2, 3, 5 or even more depending on the number of cores in your computer.
